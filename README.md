The resulting data is was collected from two months over the time frame. June and December of the years covered in the analysis
* The mean temps where about what you would exepect June and December. December was 8 degrees colder than June
* December also had a lower min temp at 60 compared to June's 71 min
* The largest standout from the results was the max temp. The difference between the max temps was only 3 degrees.

# Summary
At a high level is seems that there wouldn't be a huge amount of variation in sales due to the temp. The stats of the June and December are very close and the mean temp is within 10 degrees. 
Some other information that would be useful would be wind speed and along with that what the temp feesl like. Living in the Inland NorthWest I can tell you that wind chill makes a huge difference. 
I would also combine with the analysis that we did in the modual to show what an average day looks like on the island. 
Given that we have the temps from year round it would also be useful to show some graphs of what the mean temps looks like over time and possibly show a tend upward as time goes by.
